# SMS gateway

Very rough demo (this is a hack day) of an email to SMS gateway.

# Usage

Written in Python.

To run, first set up a virtual environment and `pip install requiremnts.txt` 

send.py reads from stdin and sends an SMS to a number, using a twilio account.

Use `cat test_mail.email | python send.py` for testing.
